<p>Hello! Welcome to the my current incarnation. I am the page that will hold
the content generated by a certain Pratik Mallya. Apparantly, he has 
wanted to create me for a very long time now. He does not like to put his
content in places like wordpress or blogger where it is so super hard to
configure what it looks like. But Github...he trusts that. So, he created
me.
</p><p>
So who is my creator? As you already know, his name is Pratik Mallya, and
he does not like WP or blogger (or medium or ...) He is a Software Engineer
by day... and Software Engineer by night also. He likes building and making
useful stuff and...mostly stuff that has no use also. 
</p><p>
I have been created as the first iteration of his output online. I do have
previous incarnations; hand coded HTML just like I am now, and if you search
the internet deep enough you will find them. But hopefully, my creater has
learnt just enough web technologies and design to make me look better than
what I do now (or I did earlier). 
</p>
<p>
Thanks for visiting me! I won't be around for much longer, but you will see
a better incarnation of me in the near future.
