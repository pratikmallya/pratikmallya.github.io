My first experience with City Biking was in Austin. Back then, as a new grad without a car, biking was the only mode of transportation other than taking the Bus. The company I worked at the time had a very pro-biking culture with a lot of folks biking in; they were generous enough to hand me a spare bike, so off I went.

At the time (around 2014), there weren't any protected bike lanes. There were sharrows, though. Biking on sharrows was, to put it mildly, terrifying. It was fine in low traffic conditions. But during the morning commute, several cars/trucks would honk and accelerate past me with abandon, some cursing along the way. The vast majority of vehicles did not do this, but it only takes one bad actor to ruin the ride. Well, I learned my lesson and quickly bought a car, and that was the end of my experience with biking.


Its now 2022. I'm in San Franciso now. Many streets have dedicated/protected bike lanes. There are bikeshares all over the city. To be quite frank, I did not really pay much attention. In my mind, biking had been cemented as a dangerous mode of transport, and the only people that would bike a lot would be hardcore bikers and tourists.
