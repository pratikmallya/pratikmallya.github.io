I don't think I can ever truly get over the fact that today, if I'm curious 
about something, anything, all it takes is a search in any popular web 
service to instantly locate all kinds of explanations about that phenomena.
From Quantum Physics to History, everything is available online, for free.

I tried to imagine a person in the 19th century. Average literacy was 
much lower. Imagine not being able to read! Your view of the world and of 
truth itself is limited, paradigms of the world are very different. You would 
have to rely on *talking* to other people to get information about anything.
How would you capture your amazing ideas? Not possible.

For the persons who could read, the avenues for getting information still seemed
quite limited. Newspapers, magazines were perhaps the most regular forms of 
disseminating knowledge. It seems like a very *push* based form of information
communication, where knowledge and information, and events were centralized 
and then blasted out to the millions to consume. And the consumers had only 
these sources of information.

Today, its a *pull* based form where every individual is given several different 
options in a media diet, and it is for them to decide what to feast on. 
Their worldview is thus shaped by this media diet. Just like with literal diets,
 trashy media diets seem to be tasty and irresistable to refuse for most.

Back to the 19th century. Even the highly educated folks needed to be near 
other educated folks in Universities and such. Universities around the world,
thus, formed the nodes of a global, human network of knowledge. No surprise then
that the first packet switched, interconnected computer network (ARPANET) was 
between universtities.

Today, commercial successes have given the internet an 
unprecedented amount of importance in the daily lives of most Americans; its 
funding and upkeep is thus guaranteed. The alpha version connected universities,
the current version connects everyone.
