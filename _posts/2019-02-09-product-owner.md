Main themes:

* didn't know what it involved
* turns out its a certain kind of management
* the external interface for the team
* less time for dev work as a PO
* maybe management is not the best thing to do
* maybe rotation of roles can help
* observe ceremonies created, powers delegated in a democratic manner
* only works as long as everyone is invested in and believes in it, will it scale?
