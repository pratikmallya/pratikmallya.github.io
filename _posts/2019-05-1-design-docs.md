I have recently started writing design docs as part of the decision making process for evaluating tooling choices at work. What do I think of them? Lets make a pros and cons list:

pros
* Make a pros and cons list.
* Writing helps to organize thoughts, understand different perspectives, give immediate feedback to the writer. Cull dumb ideas quickly. Question yourself first, refine ideas before proposing the best. 
* Get feedback from others in due time instead of in a slack thread; many conversations that start in slack threads may get distracted for a wide variety of reasons.
* Document your thought process to preserve it for future use. If done right, document _others'_ thought processes and feedback too.

cons
* Takes longer.
* Slower decision making process.
* Without feedback, ivory tower with no reference to reality.
