On NYE 2021, I made a resolution: to get off of Instagram.


The proximate cause was a breakup, sort of. The general approach to this situation was to unfriend, disconnect, unfollow, whatever; possibly "block", depending on the relationship [^1]. Since it was new years, it seemed like I could go a step futher and get off the platform altogether. New years resolutions don't hold and I didn't expect this one too either. For good measure, I disabled LinkedIn too.


The benefits of the platform seemed suspect. In particular, the realization that I was optimizing my digital persona to look good for the platform... didn't seem right to me. It seemed like an external influence intruding on private moments.


I'm pleased to say, I managed to go all of 2022 without ever reactivating the Instagram (LinkedIn is a different story, I succumbed within a month and reactivated). As of today, the account lies dormant. After the twitter chaos, I parted ways with that platform too.


So what am I left with? LinkedIn and TikTok. More on that in another post.
