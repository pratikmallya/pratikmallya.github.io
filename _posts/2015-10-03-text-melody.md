The melodious tune of a text  
that came from her phone  
was unlike any other  
I made it my own.


It took me back  
to joyous days  
filled with happiness, laughter  
and intense pain.  


I remember things  
that made me love so much  
but none of the things  
that caused pain.


Such is the nature of love  
that binds people together  
Culture, age, race: terms  
love refuses to understand.


The things it recognizes  
truth, beauty, life, symmetry  
Our very best comes out  
when we love.


What separates us from machines  
faster, smarter, stronger, masters  
but one thing they can never match  
is to love so much.


I cannot escape from it  
intense feelings it has sown  
The melodious tune of a text  
that came from her phone.
