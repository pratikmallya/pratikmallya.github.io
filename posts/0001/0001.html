<h1>Introducing My New Blog</h1>
<p>
The first blog that I wrote in was in blogspot, or blogger (I'm still not 
sure what the difference is between them). I then tried Wordpress, before 
finally settling on 
<a href="http://approxint.blogspot.com/">blogger</a>
again. To be fair, the new blogger is pretty 
good, and I do like the minimalistic theme. However, I wanted absolute,
complete control over my website. Why? Ownership breeds pride. I won't 
put in personal manual labor improving the garden of my rented house.
But if it was my own, I most certainly would. 
</p>
<p>
Similarly, with complete 
ownership over my content and how it's displayed, I can put in effort into
designing it better. I mean CSS-styles better. I mean having the option to
use superb UI frameworks like 
<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I've decided to start with a very simplistic, very very minimalistic design
though. I will be playing around with CSS to make it look nicer, but I won't 
be putting in any flashy stuff. My inspiration is the indomitable Mike 
Bostock, whose <a href="">blog</a> made me realize that features does not
equal beauty. (He also resolved the very important problem of naming one's
blog: simply use your full name).
</p>
<p>In the interest of complete disclosure, my previous blog, which I also 
tried to be as simplistic as possible, is 
<a href="https://web.engr.illinois.edu/~mallya2/">here</a>. Since there
appears no way to de-host it, I'm apparently stuck with the horrifying
memories of my rookie web design skills <em>for ever</em>. 
</p>
<p>Anyways, yes, I did get "inspiration" (read: source code) from Mike's
blog. He doesn't allow copying the code verbatim, so I only looked at 
how he was working with the CSS. The hope is to make this blog 
simplistic and <em>not</em> a clone.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, that's another reason why I've chosen to go commando,
blog wise. Webpages are representations of our digital selves, and hence
should reflect the values that we hold near and dear. Hence, the attempt
at simplicity and cleanliness.
</p>
<p>I will most likely be adding improvements constantly. I hope to not use
any external frameworks, except for adding functionality such as code 
display, image lightboxes and such. One of the things I really really want
to do is 
<a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345">learn D3</a>
and make <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">cool visualizations</a> and
show them to the world right here.
</p>
<p>
The process for creating a page is to create an HTML file manually. It is 
then pushed to Github, along with changes to the main page to link to that 
page. Its abysmally manual, but I promise to add simple automation later.
I just really wanted to get something out of the house. Also, hopefully
the minimal design will be easier to read for anyone trying to implement 
something similar. 
</p>
<p>
Wish me luck!

<h4>Configuring A Custom Domain</h4>
<p>(Added August 8 2014)</p>
<p>One of the first things I wanted was a custom domain name. There are many
reasons why you would want to host your website under a custom domain name 
rather than using Github's subdomain, but I think the most important one is 
that in case I wanted to move my site away from Github, I would have to 
change all references to my old webpage: Resume's, other websites, business
cards etc. Having you own domain name can be really cheap, I used 
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a> to obtain mine for $8 p.a.
</p>
<p>I wasn't really familiar with DNS, so at first I had trouble configuring it.
In particular, I did not configure an A record to point to the ip address of
Github. An A record is an address record, which is what tells your DNS host
(in this case, Namecheap) where he can find the content for the domain. 
Since I did not configure it, of course the content could not be found.
</p>
<p> Anyways, here's what you need to do:</p>
<ol>
    <li>add a 
        <a href="https://github.com/pratikmallya/pratikmallya.github.io/blob/master/CNAME">
            CNAME
        </a> file in your repository which contains the bare domain name
    </li>
    <li>configure <em>two</em> A records to point to the ip address of Github 
        pages in Namecheap. You can find the ip addresses
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/my-custom-domain-isn-t-working#dns-errors">
            here.    
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>Add a CNAME for the url provided by Github in Namecheap, so that everyone that 
        tries to access that url will be redirected to your new page. So,
        my case I added a CNAME record with url as 
        <a href="http://pratikmallya.github.io">pratikmallya.github.io</a>.
        Therefore, anyone entering that url in the browser will be 
        automatically redirected to my custom domain name 
        <a href="http://pratikmallya.github.io">pratikmallya.me.</a>
    </li>
</ol>
