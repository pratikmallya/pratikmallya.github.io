<h1>DevOps and Money</h1>

<p>
  Yesterday, I attended my first ever
  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CloudAustin/">Cloud Austin Meetup</a>.
  My motivation was mostly networking, free food and peeking into the
  offices of Rackspace, a potential future employer.
</p>

<p>
  The office was basically huge open spaces partitioned into cubicles. Not
  really my idea of a dream place to work at. I can imagine the din that
  would be present everyday. People coming in, talking over phones etc.
  As usual, in an attempt to make it habitable, it was plastered with
  various memorablia: University emblems, country flags and so on. Anyways,
  since I did not see them actually at work, I can't really say how good or
  bad it would be in regular hours (I went there around 7pm)
</p>
<p>
  The food itself was BBQ and really nice. But it was the networking that was
  the best part. I met a guy who had his own consultancy-kind of company; it
  looked like they would architect cloud-based solutions to other companies
  problems, or maybe assist/advise them on their cloud-based strategy. The
  talk itself was extremely interesting.
  <a href="http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/">Dustin Kirkland</a> demoed an
  orange-box: a suitcase sized machine that was a DIY that canonical did
  to basically demo Juju. That's basically what Dustin did, although of course
  I'm doing his beautiful talk no justice. The cool thing about Juju is the
  GUI: its like a graphical interface that explicitly shows the relationships
  between the different stacks that are being deployed. So, Heat depends on
  MySQL, so MySQL is fetched and installed first, and then Heat and so on.
  Basically, a way to quickly deploy a complete environment for development or
  production, in an idempotent and repeatable manner. Even from my scant
  experience of Ops, I could see that this is a fucking amazing tool.
</p>
<p>
  Dustin demoed something called MaaS: Machine as a Service. I was confused
  for a bit: how can you deploy anything to 'bare metal'? You need some
  kind of OS running, right? Dustin explained that the machines were being
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a>
  booted. I'm guessing there is some kind of minimal OS that is being booted,
  and then he showed how VM's could be provisioned. It was currently only
  Ubuntu, but he mentioned that they would soon allow Windows images too,
  which would surely be a HUGE deal for all the windows sysadmins out there.
  Anyways, Dustin seemed to be arguing that it might be cost-effective for
  organizations to run their own clouds with little overhead, rather than
  rely on someone elses cloud. I don't think startups will give up the
  convenience of Amazon anytime soon, but once an established traffic pattern
  has been established, it might make sense to roll your own stuff.
</p>
<p>
  But I think the most interesting conversation was one I had with Boyd. Since
  I did not consider myself a DevOps, the conversation had drifted to what
  exactly a DevOps does. I had worked with Chip over at Enthought, so I was
  familiar somewhat with what DevOps people did, but Boyd had an interesting
  example.
</p>
<p>
  Simply stated, if Rob has a PR which is avaiting merge into the production
  code, that is basically X amount of hours, and hence Y amount of money,
  which was basically tied up there in the PR. The longer one waited to
  merge the PR, the more money was being locked up, spent without returns.
  Whereas if one had a rigorous CI and testing system set up, then the feature
  would never languish, and that money would never lie in limbo.
</p>
<p>
  This was such a stupidly simple concept, but I had never thought of it that
  way at all. I certainly understood and even implemented agile methodology to
  become more productive. But, I never really thought of it as being something
  serious: more like motivational speeches. Great if you hear them, not much
  missed if you don't. But this example really drove home the point that it
  was the most precious resource, money, that was being tied up just because
  stuff wasn't organized well enough.
</p>
<p>
  And then it struck me: basically, money was being used as a metric to improve
  performance. After all, businesses are in existence due to the requirement of
  generating that one resource. So it made so much sense to measure things
  directly in terms of money. In fact, I wondered if it would make me value my
  own time more, if I thought about how much opportunity cost was being lost
  if I was not productive. In isolation, metrics mean very little; tied to
  something as valuable as money, they immediately start making sense.
