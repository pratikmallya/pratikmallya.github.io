Since 2013
:   *Software Engineer at [Enthought](https://www.enthought.com)*
    (Austin, Texas).

    * Designed backend and frontend for 
    [Enthought Training on Demand](https://training.enthought.com),
    a comprehensive library of hands-on, online Python training courses 
    designed by practicing scientific and analytic software developers.
    This website was designed using AngularJS as an application 
    framework, is written mostly in CoffeeScript and uses Foundation as
    its UI framework.

    * Overhauled the tool used by content creators to upload material
    (videos, subtitles etc) to the website. 
    
    * Automation scripts for transfer of content between places (local to 
    Staging to Production).

Summer 2012
:   *Software Engineer Intern at [Enthought](https://www.enthought.com)*
    (Austin, Texas).
    
    Automated the build-test-release process used for the development of 
    over 100 python packages as part of the Enthought Python Distribution
    (EPD), a process which had previously required a full-time build engineer.

Summer 2009
:   *Engineering Intern at [BARC](http://www.barc.gov.in/)*
     (Mumbai, India)

     Worked at the Ultasonic Intstrumentation Section, a part of the Electronics Division. Wrote a Graph Plotting Program in Visual Basic from Scratch. This Program obtained real time data from ultrasonic transducers (used to detect cracks in casings of fuel rods, a process know as Non-Destructive Testing) and analysed it to give the user a detailed picture of the frequency spectrum picked up by the transducers.
